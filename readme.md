## Microsoft Cortana Hackathon

* This is our submission for a Microsoft Cortana Skill implemented using Node.js and Azure cloud computing.

* The idea behind this project was to allow users to chain together multiples commands to Cortana without having to reprompt Cortana each time as a part of a regular routine in their lives, i.e. their morning routine or their commute routine.

**Disclaimer**

* This code was written within a very short time period for a competition using technologies that its contributors were not familar with initially.
